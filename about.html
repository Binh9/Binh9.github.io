							The very first time I was exposed to computer science was back in high school, and I fell in love with it ever since. I was amazed by things it could do, and it seemed that the only limitation to its capabilities was our imagination.
						</p>
						<p>
							I decided to pursue this field further in college, and I'm really glad I made that decision despite all of those sleepless nights spent grasping the concepts and material. Here at Northeastern, as I solidified my Computer Science fundamentals in software development, program design, 	systems and networks, and algorithms and data structures, my passion for technology only grew exponentially. Thanks to pair programming, group projects, and assignments, I've also developed excellent communication and collaboration skills necessary to be a contributing team player.
						</p>
						<p>
							I strongly believe in the idea of building a piece of software with the purpose of solving a real issue. Recently, I've been exceptionally interested in human-centered computing and how it affects the whole software development process. I believe learning about human interaction with technology and analyzing ways to improve that interaction is essential in the development of software targeted for those humans.
						</p>
						<p>
							Currently, I am looking for a Co-op opportunity where I would be able to put the learned skills to test and gain more hands-on experience developing software alongside professionals with similar vision.
