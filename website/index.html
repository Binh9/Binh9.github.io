								Hi! My name is Binh Le. I am a fourth-year student at Northeastern University, majoring in Computer and Information Sciences. I was exposed to computer science back in high school and fell in love with it ever since. As I progress towards my degree completion, I've come to reaffirm that the only limitation to computer's capabilities is our imagination. I have a solid knowledge base of Computer Science fundamentals and am eager to explore and learn new technologies. As a result of working on multiple group projects and assignments, I have developed great communication and collaboration skills necessary to be an excellent team player. Currently, I am looking for a Co-op opportunity where I would be able to put the skills learned in classrooms to test and gain more hands-on experience working in the computer science field.
